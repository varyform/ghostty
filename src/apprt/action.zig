    //    compatibility, new actions should be added to the end of the enum.
    //
    // 2. Add the action and optional value to the Action union.
    //
    // 3. If the value type is not void, ensure the value is C ABI
    //    compatible (extern). If it is not, add a `C` decl to the value
    //    and a `cval` function to convert to the C ABI compatible value.
    //
    // 4. Update `include/ghostty.h`: add the new key, value, and union
    //    entry. If the value type is void then only the key needs to be
    //    added. Ensure the order matches exactly with the Zig code.
